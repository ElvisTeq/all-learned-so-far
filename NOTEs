#1
Used `template litereals` in "Card.js"

- To inject own className + className from {props.children}

#2
Pop Error window message in "ErrorModal.js"

- Implemented in "AddUser.js"

* Used "useState" to conditionally create error messages
* Using Conditional {&&} to return JSX <ErrorModal> (to show window message or not)

* Created a function that changes the condition that shows <ErrorModal> (to show window message or not)
* Added "onClick={}" to the location we want to trigger this function

* Noted => <div> outside another <div> will make changes outside its element => "ErrorModal.js"
